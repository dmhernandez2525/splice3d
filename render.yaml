# Splice3D - Render Infrastructure Configuration
# ==============================================
# This is primarily a CLI tool, but this config enables:
# 1. Running the GUI/web interface (if implemented)
# 2. API endpoint for G-code processing
#
# NOTE: The core splice3d functionality is meant to run locally
# connected to the splicing hardware. This deployment is for
# the post-processor and recipe generation only.
#
# Cost: $0/month (free tier)

services:
  # =============================================
  # API Server - G-code Post-Processor

# NOTE: This deployment requires creating an api_server.py in the cli/ folder.
# The API would expose endpoints like:
# - POST /process - Upload G-code, receive recipe JSON
# - POST /validate - Validate a recipe file
# - GET /health - Health check
#
# For local hardware control, use the CLI tools directly on the machine
# connected to the splice3d hardware.
