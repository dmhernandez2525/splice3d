# F1.4 3D Printed Parts

## Scope

This feature delivers a complete printable parts package for enclosure, mounting, guides, ducts, spool support, and cable management.

## Artifacts

1. CAD source: `hardware/f1_4/cad/`
2. Design manifest: `hardware/f1_4/spec/printed_parts_design.json`
3. Per-part print settings: `hardware/f1_4/print_profiles/*_README.md`
4. Validation module: `postprocessor/printed_parts_validation.py`
5. Validation script: `scripts/hardware/validate_f1_4.py`
6. Tests: `postprocessor/tests/test_printed_parts_validation.py`

## Included Printed Systems

1. Main enclosure bottom with cable channels and captive nut slots
2. Main enclosure top with ventilation and HEPA mount pocket
3. Internal mounting brackets for SKR, steppers, and PSU
4. Filament guide blocks and smooth transition guides
5. Tool and accessory mounts for hex keys, blades, and PTFE
6. Ventilation ducts for fan flow and heater exhaust
7. Spool holder for 1kg spool geometry (`200mm OD`, `55mm hub`)
8. Cable management channels and strain relief blocks

## Design Rules

1. All major parts remain within `220x220mm` bed envelope.
2. Critical functional areas are defined as support-free.
3. Snap-fit features include minimum retention force thresholds.
4. Print profile README exists per output STL target.

## Print Orientation and Supports

Per-part profile files define:
1. material
2. orientation
3. layer height
4. infill
5. support policy

Critical areas such as filament channels, snap clips, and bracket interfaces are explicitly set for no-support printing.

## Verification Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/hardware/validate_f1_4.py
python3 -m unittest postprocessor.tests.test_printed_parts_validation -v
```

Validation confirms:
1. all parts fit standard bed limits
2. snap-fit retention thresholds are met
3. critical areas remain support-free
4. source CAD and per-part profile files exist
5. spool holder geometry meets 1kg spool requirements
